Sudoku Solver is a program that was created to solve sudokus because I don't know how to solve sudoku by myself. The project helped me learn how to utilize Java and for loops in order to properly solve and fill out a sudoku.

Sudoku Solver was created in Eclipse (an integrated development environment) and written in Java. The SudokuTest class can contain an unsolved sudoku problem that a user can go and input themselves. The role I played in creating this was basically the main person to make the code work. 

In this project I gained experience with Java and different structures. Additionally I gained a better understanding of how Sudoku works in general which can be helpful at times as well but the main thing would be learning and better understanding Java.
