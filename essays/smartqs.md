Asking smart questions doesn’t necessarily mean there are dumb questions, a smart question simply means that a question was asked in a smart way. The ability to ask smart questions is a skill that goes beyond just the field of software engineering. If an individual is unable to properly ask a smart question, it may lead to both ineffective and inefficient help. 

## What is a Smart Question?

There are a lot of factors that come into play when trying to ask a smart question. These things include knowing where to ask, having meaningful subject headers, easy to reply to, easy to understand, and including a detailed/informative description of the problem as well as what has been tried already to fix the problem. When discussing the problem, this would probably be the most important part of asking a question in a smart way. This is because when describing the problem, it is best to describe what the goal is so people can understand how to help. Additionally, describing the symptoms of a problem and listing out solutions that have been attempted can save time as well as provide people with an understanding of what didn’t work. By doing so, it’ll allow for more efficient and effective solutions. Furthermore, not including information like the environment (machine, OS, application, etc) and the vendor’s distribution and release level may cause some delays in effective answers. This is especially important since not everyone uses the same things, a computer or software configuration could be entirely different for another person. 

Some additional things to consider would be having some courtesy. Being grammatical, clear, precise, and descriptive are all important but it is also important to be appreciative of people online who are helping to solve problems. It is also polite to not label or flag questions as urgent since it can come off as rude or selfish. It is important to note that everyone has questions and those questions can be important but it’s only important to themselves not other people online. Therefore, it is best to not label things as urgent when asking people online for help on platforms such as Stack Overflow or Web and IRC forums. Not labeling homework questions as urgent and not posting homework and asking for the answers to it are aspects of a smart question. A not so smart question on the other hand is simply the opposite of everything that was listed. 

## Example of a Smart Question

A good example of a smart question would be a question asked by a person on Stack Overflow named po.studio. In this post by this user, their title is called “React JS-Uncaught TypeError: this.props.data.map is not a function” which already gives people a glimpse of what the problem is and what environment. In this post, the user asks how to prevent the error which is great since it is concise. The user also includes links to solutions that they have tried and stated that they don’t work along with including information from their findings. Additionally, they include their code to better show people their problem. This is considered a smart question because it is concise, grammatical, descriptive, and includes solutions that were attempted but failed along with the findings of their research. 

Looking at the solutions that were provided to the user po.studio, it can be seen that there were many helpful responses. There was an especially helpful response, which was the top rated response, that effectively communicated the solution to the question and also included a modified code with recommendations. This response was both very effective and efficient as it gave the answer to the problem immediately because people understood what was being asked and even possibly provided an even more efficient solution. 

## Example of a Not So Smart Question

A good example of a not so smart question would be a question asked on Stack Overflow by the user named Mourad Karoudi. In this user’s question, they titled it “Why live() not working with jQuery?” which isn’t really recommended as it doesn’t provide much information. Additionally, the user simply states “I write this code. But I don’t know why it is not working” then proceeds to include a block of code. This isn’t a smart way of asking a question because it does not include what the error is, what possible solutions were attempted, information about the environment, and what the goal of the code is. 

Looking at the solutions that were provided to the user named Mourad Karoudi, there was only one solution posted and it got downvoted with many people in the comments section asking things like what version of jQuery was being used, what the meaning of not working was, and even saying comments like “Time to learn to look in browser console for errors and report them in questions”. Based on the comments and solutions on the post, it is evident that not asking questions in a smart way can greatly impact the effectiveness and efficiency of an answer.


## Importance?

Asking smart questions is important and knowing how to ask smart questions is even more important for smart software engineers. As seen in examples, a smart question can lead to effective and efficient solutions that could possibly help to improve your own code. The level of smartness from a question is pretty much equivalent to the smartness of the answer. I’ve personally learned a lot from this experience as I’ve noticed while scrolling through Stack Overflow that many people who asked smart questions often received answers that were concise and sometimes even suggestions on how to improve. All of this wouldn’t have been possible without a smart question. I’ve learned the consequences of not so smart questions and how it can hinder my progress. Overall, I’ve developed a better understanding of how to formulate and ask smart questions which is something I will practice doing more of.
