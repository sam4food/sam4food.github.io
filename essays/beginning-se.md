## How It Started

Software engineering has always been a topic of interest for me as a curious learner. With the dynamic and unique nature of it, there are many ways code can be used to create complicated systems that power the digital world that so many people rely on today. My interest in software engineering stems from the creativity and logic behind it which pushes me to learn more about the field of software engineering and to go deeper into it. Furthermore the topic of software engineering seemed much more interesting than things like biology which was why I decided to further pursue computer science. 

## How It's Going

In the field of software engineering, things are always going to be changing but some skills that I hope to develop would be the ability to quickly adapt to situations so that I can accurately and efficiently complete complex challenges. Additionally, I hope to develop skills in things like JavaScript since it is quite an important language for software engineering. Another skill I do hope to develop would be the ability to collaborate at a high level because that way I will know how to work in a group and how to effectively contribute to a group.

In terms of experiences, I hope to gain valuable experience in the area of frontend and backend development. By doing so it will hopefully help me strengthen my understanding of full-stack development, leading me to have the ability to create a smooth user experience. I am further interested in the way things like artificial intelligence and machine learning can be used within software engineering or the other way around. These things can help create new resources for many people and make advancements in making applications that can better adapt and learn based on user interactions. I do hope to gain some experience in open-source contributions since that seems to be helpful as well

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I may not have the strongest background for software engineering but I am still deeply interested in this field and hope to make some sort of contribution in the field of software engineering.
