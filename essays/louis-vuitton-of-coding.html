<p>Why do design patterns make great comedians
Because they have the best “class” with their inheritance and always know how to deliver the perfect “template” for a good joke!</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-introduction-about-design-patterns">A BRIEF INTRODUCTION ABOUT DESIGN PATTERNS</h2>
<p>A software design pattern is a reusable solution to a common problem in software engineering, not a finished design that can be directly transformed into source or machine code.</p>

<h2 id="publish-subscribe-design-pattern">Publish Subscribe Design Pattern</h2>
<p>The Subscription and Publication design pattern from the Meteor framework is a crucial tool in software development, fostering a symbiotic relationship between a storyteller and their audience. The Publication design pattern disseminates information, while the Subscription design pattern allows subscribers to focus on different aspects of the published data, each receiving personalized updates based on their subscriptions. This design pattern forms the backbone of real-time data communication in Meteor, allowing modules to remain dynamically linked, ensuring changes in one area propagate to interested parties without explicit polling or manual intervention. The Subscription and Publication design pattern creates a harmonious and responsive ecosystem for users and developers, ensuring seamless data exchange and communication within the software realm.</p>

<p>Why did the Publish Subscribe Design Pattern start a comedy show? Because it knew how to disseminate information to its subscribers in a way that left everyone in stitches, forming a real-time connection that was more dynamic than a punchline propagation in Meteor!</p>

<h2 id="singleton-design-pattern">Singleton Design Pattern</h2>
<p>The Singleton design pattern is a crucial principle in software architecture, akin to a guardian of a castle. It ensures that only one instance of a particular class exists, allowing controlled access to its unique resources. This pattern mirrors the guardian’s role in a castle, overseeing the creation of a single, globally accessible instance of a class. Singleton instances grant access to critical services or resources within an application, such as managing system configurations, controlling access to a shared database connection, or orchestrating logging functionalities. However, Singleton has potential drawbacks, such as tight coupling, limiting flexibility, and hindering testability. When used judiciously, Singleton serves as a stalwart protector, ensuring the controlled and efficient utilization of critical resources within the software architecture.</p>

<p>Why did the Singleton design pattern go to the party alone? Because it wanted to ensure it was the only instance of fun in the software realm—no duplicate parties allowed!</p>

<h2 id="overall-thoughts-on-design-patterns">Overall Thoughts on Design Patterns</h2>
<p>Design patterns in software engineering are reusable solutions, such as the Publish Subscribe pattern in Meteor for real-time communication and the Singleton pattern for ensuring a single instance for critical resources, showcasing structured problem-solving approaches that balance reusability and efficiency. Nonetheless, there are many other various design patterns that can be used to make us better developers, and this is just the start of my Designer Adventure to become the Louis Vuitton of Coding – to know more design patterns and apply them in my coding.</p>
