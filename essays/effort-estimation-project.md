## Introduction

The task involved providing time estimates for new project issues, including the identifier of the person making the estimate. These estimates are likely to be inaccurate but aid in project planning and coordination. To track effort invested in each issue, IntelliJ's timer was used. The collected effort data is intended for a study on error in effort estimation by novice software engineers. Participants were encouraged to use the timer extension to enhance data accuracy, with extra credit for providing high-quality data. This process emphasizes the importance of accurate record-keeping for research purposes.

## Effort Estimates

The way I created effort estimates was by looking at my experience and considering how long a task would take based on previous assignments. For example, the creation of a web page or landing page might take me a couple of minutes which is what I would base it off of. In the beginning, I didn't really have a clear idea of how long I would take but I had a general idea as most of these tasks were things that I've done before. Some of these things were even on WODs that we did in class, the only difference being that it wasn't the same content. The overall structure though would be more or less the same.  Despite this, I would still sometimes underestimate the amount of time I would actually spend on certain tasks. 

Looking at the data, it is clear that even though the estimates had progressively gotten more accurate, it is almost impossible to accurately determine the amount of effort and time needed on a specific task. This is evident as the time estimated and the actual time spent were often close but still not the same.

## Benefits of Effort Estimates

Estimating effort in advance is a valuable communication tool in professional settings, providing group members with an approximation of the time required to complete a task. This information is crucial for coordinating efforts within a project or workflow, allowing for better planning and resource allocation. Despite occasional inaccuracies, making estimates facilitates better project management and resource allocation, fosters transparency, and helps establish realistic expectations, contributing to a more organized and efficient workflow. As stated by many professionals in the Software Engineering field, being organized not only helps the workflow of employees, but it also helps to benefit the company as a whole, allowing for rapid development and avoidance of major financial loss. Even though it is a challenge to predict effort accurately, estimations are a valuable tool for effective project planning and coordination on both a small and large scale.

During the project, there was one notable benefit of estimating effort in advance. It was during a busy week and there were tasks that needed to be completed. Due to the somewhat accurate estimations, I was able to determine how much time I would need to finish creating certain pages for the website while balancing my assignments for other courses. Thanks to the estimates, I was able to get the pages completed on time while successfully completing my assignments for other courses. Had it not been for the effort estimations, I highly doubt that I would have been able to complete the necessary tasks on time for my group.

## Benefit of Tracking Actual Effort

There were some benefits of tracking actual effort expended on certain issues. Although the estimated times were already pretty accurate to the actual times spent on tasks, knowing that I often underestimate a task has helped me take that into consideration when deciding how much time in my day that I would need to allocate for a certain task. Even though I knew I often underestimated, I would still underestimate the time needed since the times were often close enough already. If I were to estimate a longer time, I could potentially overestimate how long I would take. Overall, tracking actual effort allowed me to have a better understanding of how I perceive time needed per task and my tendencies. As a team, it was especially helpful as we could see other group member's habits when it comes to effort estimation and actual time spent on a task. This allowed for a more organized workflow and enabled us as a team to effectively estimate when deadlines should be set.

## How Data Was Collected

I used both IntelliJ's timer and a clock to measure time spent. The clock was used to cross reference the IntelliJ's timer as it would give me a rough estimate and show me whether the time I had from IntelliJ was accurate or not. The accuracy of the tracking could definitely be better but that is to be expected as it is very difficult to accurately determine the total amount of time spent on each task. Additionally, non-coding effort was a bit difficult to track as it may be a bit hard to determine how long you were putting effort into something not related to coding. However, IntelliJ's timer does have a function that tells you the time you were away but it might be slightly inaccurate. Overall, the collected data was pretty accurate in my opinion.
