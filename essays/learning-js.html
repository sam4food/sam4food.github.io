<p><em>JavaScript From a Beginner’s Point of View</em></p>

<h2 id="learning-a-new-language">Learning a New Language</h2>

<p>As a person who knows only a couple of programming languages such as Java and Python, Javascript doesn’t seem too difficult to learn. This is probably because I have some prior programming knowledge but Javascript does seem easier than Java in my opinion and even someone new to programming might have an easier time understanding Javascript over Java.</p>

<p>Describing how Javascript compares to other programming languages that I know wouldn’t be too difficult. Python compared to Javascript seems to be easier to learn and use mainly because of how simple Python can be as well as syntax. Java is definitely harder to learn and use compared to Javascript so far but who knows maybe Javascript might become harder for me to use than Java. Although this does seem quite unlikely since Java has so many more factors or rules to consider when worrying about code not working compared to Javascript. When I was introduced to Javascript through FreeCodeCamp, I was introduced to ES6 which was definitely quite interesting. I managed to learn a lot of things like arrow functions and syntax from ES6 which again was easier to understand than some of Java’s syntax.</p>

<h2 id="opinion-on-javascript">Opinion on JavaScript</h2>

<p>At this point in time with my current knowledge, I believe that Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. As a versatile language, it can be helpful for software development as it is supported on many platforms and can be used in frontend and backend development. Naturally every language does come with its own cons but overall Javascript appears to be a pretty good language from a software engineering perspective.</p>

<h2 id="layout-ase-preferred">Layout: ASE Preferred</h2>

<p>Athletic Software Engineering, a new concept recently introduced to me, is a completely different learning experience from what I’m used to in most classes. Being provided with practice in class through WODs is something that I believe to be extremely useful and helps build confidence in solving similar problems. Additionally, having this sort of practice and style of learning definitely promotes much better growth since it gives people practice and by practicing people will learn. Most of the time, students like myself might not be compelled to put in time and effort to practice outside of class but by having this type of style of learning it makes up for the lack of outside practice. I personally find the WODs enjoyable but at the same time a bit stressful since I always try to meet the recommended time for completion. However, even though it may be stressful at times it is definitely enjoyable because I get to learn from practice rather than read a textbook and I can learn more about different solutions to the WODs afterwards. I strongly believe that WODs and the athletic software engineering approach will greatly help me as I’m already seeing better results from this learning style compared to the traditional learning style. I’m understanding better, I have more knowledge on different solutions to various problems, and my confidence to complete a timed exercise has greatly improved.</p>
