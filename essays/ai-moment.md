## I. Introduction

AI has significantly impacted education, especially in technical fields like Software Engineering. In ICS 314, AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot have been essential in navigating complex concepts. These tools offer assistance in coding, problem-solving, and conceptual understanding.


## II. Personal Experience with AI

**Experience WODs:** For experience WODs, there was no use of AI. The reason behind this was that the purpose of Experience WODs are to learn and figure out how things work. This was the main reason why I personally did not use AI when it came to these WODs. Additionally, there wasn’t really a need to do so as there were usually demonstration videos that were included which was very helpful whenever I was stuck on something. Furthermore, the use of AI would’ve been harder to use compared to just referring to the video because you would have to prompt ChatGPT or any other AI to make it suit the WOD.

**In-class Practice WODs:** In-class Practice WODs were WODs that I used AI for. However, this was only for Co-Pilot since it helped speed up the process of completing the WOD. Additionally, it was only minimal usage as sometimes it doesn’t fill out what is required.

**In-class WODs:** For actual graded WODs I would turn off Co-Pilot though so that I could practice completing WODs under time constraints and without the help of AI. 

**Essays:** AI tools were valuable for suggesting relevant content and structuring ideas. However, they are typically not that useful when it comes to actually writing the content within an essay. This is why I did not use AI to help write my essays. The only time I would use AI for essays would be to better structure my essays so that it followed a structure that might be better suited for the topic. However, there were times where I disagreed with the AI suggested structures so I wouldn’t use AI for those essay scenarios. 

**Final project:** AI did not play any roles in the final project. The reason why is that the purpose of a final project is to test our knowledge, not AI’s knowledge and capabilities. 

**Learning a concept/tutorial:** AI offered supplemental explanations but fell short in providing comprehensive understanding. Additionally, some of the responses generated by AI when given a simple question could’ve caused more confusion rather than clarification. However, there were times when explaining just what things like a simple schema was and how it works can help provide massive clarification. 

**Answering questions in class/Discord:** AI tools aided in generating potential solutions, but their accuracy varied, necessitating manual verification. Additionally, I didn't really answer many questions in class or on Discord so I didn’t use AI in this.

**Asking or answering a smart-question:** In my time in ICS 314, I haven’t really answered or asked any smart-questions. However, I’ve tried to use AI and asked it some smart-questions and it worked to a small extent. When prompted with “How can I fix this problem” and providing a list of solutions that was already attempted, AI would typically give a solution that would work. However, other times it would just give a solution that was already attempted.

**Coding examples:** AI tools were beneficial in providing initial code snippets and explanations. However, they lacked the finesse required for comprehensive code documentation and quality assurance. Additionally, sometimes the responses that ChatGPT produced were just completely wrong. This would sometimes happen when I would throw the entire prompt or instructions into ChatGPT. Although ChatGPT couldn’t really produce accurate answers, it was capable of providing examples and explanations but I didn’t need to use it. 

**Explaining code:** AI tools are generally very accurate when given code to explain. However, the only thing is that sometimes it may require a large amount of code as context. Despite that, it does a good job of explaining it and I sometimes use it to explain something that I don’t understand.

**Writing code:** Similar to coding examples by AI tools, they are beneficial in providing initial code snippets and explanations. However, they lack the ability to properly write code that successfully fulfills the requirements of an assignment. Co-Pilot does a better job at doing this compared to ChatGPT but I personally do not use it. 

**Documenting code:** AI tools do a decent job of documenting code however, I do not use it. I don’t have much experience in documenting code either with AI tools as I never really found the need to.

**Quality assurance:** AI is capable of providing quality assurance and I’ve used it multiple times for my code. Whether it’s to check why something isn’t working or why there might be an error, most of the time these errors stem from uncaught typos and AI tools like ChatGPT does a good job of pointing them out for me.

**Other uses in ICS 314:** AI assisted in determining better wording choices for some of my essays to which I would take inspiration from. However, other than that there wasn’t really any other use of AI in ICS 314.
 

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

AI facilitated faster problem-solving but sometimes hindered in-depth understanding due to reliance on generated solutions without complete comprehension. For that reason, I made sure to limit my use of AI in ICS 314 since becoming reliant on AI will not only hinder my academic progress in ICS 314 but also my other classes.

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside ICS 314, AI applications have revolutionized software engineering by automating code testing, optimizing workflows, and enhancing decision-making processes. I’ve never personally used AI in other applications like HACC but I do use it on a daily basis for simple tasks. Such as making life decisions and determining whether or not to purchase something.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities 

Challenges include the limitations of AI in nuanced problem-solving. Opportunities lie in refining AI tools to encourage critical thinking while leveraging their speed and accuracy. Additionally, there are methods that can be used in order to prompt AI to be guided to better solving complex problems. Education and AI will soon be closely intertwined in my opinion as it is already being encouraged in some courses.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

AI-enhanced learning accelerates information acquisition but may compromise deeper understanding compared to traditional methods emphasizing manual problem-solving. Furthermore, the use of AI learning can result in shorter knowledge retention and lesser engagement in traditional learning. These factors are major concerns as it may hinder the overall learning capabilities of individuals.

## VII. Future Considerations

Future integration should focus on refining AI tools to encourage critical thinking and in-depth comprehension while maintaining their efficiency. There are definitely challenges that already exist and would likely become more prevalent in the future. One major challenge would be for educators and their job to ensure that academic honesty is upheld in classrooms.

## VIII. Conclusion

AI tools in ICS 314 provided valuable support, but a balanced approach that combines AI assistance with manual problem-solving is essential for comprehensive learning. Recommendations include refining AI tools for nuanced problem-solving and emphasizing critical thinking in their use. I would recommend the usage of AI to be low as it can hinder the learning process of individuals and only to use it as a learning tool when there are no other options available. Despite how convenient it is, googling an answer and doing your own research would ultimately lead to a greater level of understanding and learning of a topic.
