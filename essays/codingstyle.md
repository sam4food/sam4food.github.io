## Coding Standard

The purpose of coding standards is to help with readability and ease of understanding. Having easy to read code can definitely help individuals learn programming languages since having some sort of standard can teach people different aspects of the language. These aspects include syntax and understanding how the programming language even works. However, at times having to pay so much attention to small little details can be annoying. This is especially true when under a time limit or time constraint. Sometimes writing code in whatever way and making sure it works takes priority first but coding style may be an important factor on whether you get the grade or not so that is something that may seem quite unappealing about having coding standards. 

## ESLint

ESLint with Intellij was definitely quite interesting to use. Having used lint for another class, I noticed how easy it was to use. Additionally, I thought it was interesting how ESLint marked some things as warnings or errors when typically it wouldn’t really be an issue. I find getting the green checkmark as a fun and useful task. It ensures that my code is written in a way that people following a specific coding standard can understand. Furthermore, it benefits me as I learn how to write code more properly and clearly. Although it may be fun to have green checkmarks, sometimes there are things that are marked as warnings or errors which aren’t really errors or warnings which can be annoying at times.


## Closing Thoughts

Overall, I believe coding standards are a must regardless of how annoying or trivial it may seem as it can definitely help to teach individuals programming language. Additionally, having a coding standard makes code easier to understand and to build off of. ESLint is definitely a useful tool and getting the green check mark is extremely satisfying.
